  If you see a warning here, it means that you need to update your Podfile 
  to explicitly state on which subspec of the given module your project depends on.

  For example, if you have:

  pod 'ProtonCore-Networking'

  it means that you haven't specified whether you want to use the Alamofire or AFNetworking 
  as the underlying networking engine. Update your Podfile to something like:

  pod 'ProtonCore-Networking/Alamofire'

  In case you're not sure which subspecs are available for the particular module 
  or which one should be used, please consult the iOS core team member â€” #core-ios on Slack.
